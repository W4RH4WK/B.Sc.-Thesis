# Improved On-Board Communication for Low-Cost Mobile Robots

This project seeks to improve the communication process between the host
computer of an existing, low-cost robot, and some on-board peripherals. This
robot is used by the department of Computer Science at University of Innsbruck
for teaching students autonomous systems. The robot is driven by an Android
phone which communicates with the robot’s internal peripherals. The components
in use for this communication process introduce various problems which are
resolved by this project to ensure better user experience.

Possible prototypes have been evaluated to find the best possible solution for
the task. Although the best solution still has some flaws, another prototype
was created which brings some new benefits along. Among them are easy to use
and easy to maintain interfaces. Together with the prototypes documentation and
examples have been crafted to ensure easy access to the material for students.
Modularity of the robot has been improved which enables other people to easily
enhance the robots capabilities.

The component used in the final solution consists of a microcontroller which is
programmed to read in data from an Android phone and controls the robot
accordingly. Apart from hardware the microcontroller’s firmware has been
written together with and example Android application.
